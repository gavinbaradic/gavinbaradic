## Designer and engineer, currently building design systems that empower teams to build great experiences.

Over the last eleven years, I have focused on creating products that deliver delightful user experiences and drive meaningful business impact.

I prioritize building relationships and bridging gaps across cross-functional teams, creating a collaborative and team-oriented environment.

My passion lies in the end-to-end process of product development, from ideation to build. I have developed a strong knowledge of React, React Native, and other technologies through my self-led side projects.
