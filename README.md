I am a designer and engineer, currently focused on building design systems at [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/).

Over the last 11 years, I have focused on creating products that achieve two critical outcomes: delivering delightful user experiences and driving meaningful business impact.

As a multidisciplinary designer, I prioritize building relationships and bridging gaps across cross-functional teams, creating a collaborative and team-oriented environment.

My passion lies in the end-to-end process of product development, from ideation to design and front/back-end development. I have developed expertise in React, React Native, and other technologies through my [self-led side projects](https://gavinbaradic.com/portfolio/metabuilt-studio).
